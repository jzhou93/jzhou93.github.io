Lijiang is a historic town in the province on Yunnan in Southwestern China that was designated a world heritage site. I wanted to explore more of China as I have largely stayed in the bigger cities in the number of times that I have visited - usually with family, where we spent most of the time at relatives apartments and in restaurants. We decided to visit Yunnan and in particular Lijiang, which is well known for having a preserved old town.

Preservation of Lijiang as it turns out, is quite different from what I had expected. Lijiang, although maintaining its mud brick, timber housing structures and stone pavements, has just about commercialised everything else due to the rise of tourism and tourism businesses.

The streets were lined door to door with restaurants, inns and a variety of stores selling drums, flower cakes, silverware, traditional scarves, tea, and other assorted goods.

This however, meant that locals where scarce, with most shops operated by the more "business oriented" Han Chinese. "本地人不做生意 (I'm from out of town, the local people don't do business)" responded one of the shop keepers, when we asked if he was from here. The traditional owners have largely moved out of the ancient town area so that they are able to charge the high rents that the traditional houses now commanded. One storeowners said that a property may cost 500k yuan in rent per year, but with the rise of tourism and the foot traffic, it was bound to turn a profit.

There was also a street in the centre of the town that were filled with bars and night clubs, blasting music into the streets from around 8pm. I suspected some of the really enthusiastic night club dancers that you could see through the club windows were being paid by club owners. Our inn-keeper called these "Chao ba", noisy bars.

All the stored would shut their doors by 11pm, with the brightly lit storefronts covered up by wooden door-panels, returning the streets to an darker, old town look.

We were going to go to a nearby town called Dali, however, we decided to change our plans and visit LuGu Hu (Lake) instead, after hearing from numerous people that many areas of Dali was being renovated during the time that we were there. The road to lugu hu was completed sometime last year shortening travel time from 8 hours to 4 hours (although it took 5 for us with rest stops along the way). The road is quite dangerous, we saw numerous areas on the road where there was rockfall. We had to stop once for 20 minutes to wait for the road to be cleared of a recent rockfall.

To get to Luguhu there is an also option to fly in, however this is a newly expanded airport and flights were infrequent (3 trips per week) and regularly cancelled due to the mountain weather.

We took a shared van operated by the local Mosuo people, which cost us 80 yuan pp for a return trip - much cheaper than the few hundred being charged by the Han chinese buses (although it would have probably been more comfortable and reliable).

There are a number of small towns scattered around the lakeside, we stayed in the town of Li Ge. To get around to the different towns and attractions in the lake area, the easiest way is to rent a car or hire a driver. We hitched a ride from a nice restaurant owner to go to a cable car that took you up a nearby mountain. However, on the way back we had trouble finding a ride as it was quite busy. Fortunately a local inn-keeper hailed down a mini-van going in our direction and the driver was kind enough to take us to a lookout near our town where we could walk down to where we were staying.

Although we didn't do it, the recommended approach to exploring the lake is to rent a car or hire a driver for a day to take you around to all the destinations around the lake.

A really nice activity is to hire a boat to take you around the lake. You will need to do some haggling, but it cost us 50 yuan for a boat, which took us around the town.

On our trip to Yunnan, we also took a day trip to Jade Dragon Mountain and Lu Shui Hu (Lake). This was very touristy, so if you don't like crowds you should probably avoid it. There is a nice fenced off hike to the top of the mountain which is over 5km above sea level.
We hired a driver for $300 yuan to take us there for the day.

The food in Yunnan is awesome! There were a lot of different types of hotpots - one really nice one we had was mushroom hotpot but other nights we also had hotpot with a variety of meats.
