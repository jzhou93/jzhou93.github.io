Time to test what Google Optimise can do!

I have just created a test Google Optimise Multivariate page with 2 different variations.
Google Optimise just release this FREE A/B testing tool that is part of the Google 360 suite.
I've deployed some Simple Google Optimise code across this site, and have also integrated this with Google Analytics for reporting purposes.



With the free version, you are able to perform:
- A/B testing
- Integrate with GA reporting
- Some Multivariate testing
- Redirect tests
- Some targeting



The full version (Optimize 360) will provide:
- Google Analytics audience targeting



As part of an A/B test you can:
- edit an experiment with the Visual Editor
- add css or javascript directly in the editor
- Select audience based on javascript variables/ first party cookies/ datalayer variables
- Can integrate an optimise experiment into an activation event (datalayer.push)
