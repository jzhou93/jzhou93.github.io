Summary: A/B test in progress...

Google recently released a free optimisation and testing tool, I thought I'd try it out.

I have just created a test Google Optimise Multivariate page with 2 different variations.

I've deployed some Simple Google Optimise code across this site, and have also integrated this with Google Analytics for reporting purposes.



With the free version, you are able to perform:
1. A/B testing
2. Integrate with GA reporting
3. Some Multivariate testing
4. Redirect tests
5. Some targeting



The full version (Optimize 360) will provide:
1. Google Analytics audience targeting



As part of an A/B test you can:
1. edit an experiment with the Visual Editor
2. add css or javascript directly in the editor
3. Select audience based on javascript variables/ first party cookies/ datalayer variables
4. Can integrate an optimise experiment into an activation event (datalayer.push)
